      <p>Hello World. My name is MiaKoda Grodsky and I am learning to be a web developer through <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/"> General Assembly's</a> Web Development Immersive Program. At my previous job working for <a href="http://www.coordinatedcarehealth.com/">Coordinated Care</a>      I was a Marketing and Communications Specialist. I was responsible for updating and maintaining our company website (run through Wordpress) and the more I learned about web development, the more interested I became in pursuing it full-time.</p>

      <p>After quitting my job, I acquired freelance work re-designing WordPress websites for small non-profits, friends, and other community organizations.  My goal is to work as a freelance web-developer and travel the world documenting my experiences through
        music and photography. </p>
